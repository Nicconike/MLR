# MLR (Multiple Linear Regression)
Data Analysis Tool in Java : Multiple Linear Regression
Line_Plot.java - Two functions are used from this file , coefficient(double[] array1, double[] array2) and intercept(double[] array1, double[] array2).

coefficient function gives the coefficient value of a line by taking array of numbers as input.

intercept function calculates the intercept , or also called as y-intercept.

Regression.java - Main program to implement and analyze the multiple linear regression based on the pre-defined dataset.
